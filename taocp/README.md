## Volume 4A Combinatorial Algorithms Part 1

Volume 4a starts with math puzzles (Page 1) to demonstrate the combinatorial
search and how powerful algorithms could reduce complexity significantly (Page
6).

Then introduce the words puzzle (Page 9) and further introduce graphs from words
(Page 11). In order to use Graph tooling,  graph theory (Page 13) is carefully
studied.
