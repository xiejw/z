## c4c

This is a standalone C implementation of Connect Four, consisting of fewer than
1,050 lines of code and requiring no external dependencies. The model was
trained in Python using self-play guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

When a `BLAS` library is available—such as the `Accelerate` framework on
macOs—the implementation automatically leverages it to improve performance.

### Get Started

To play
```
make RELEASE=1

# If you have openblas installed on Linux, try this
# On macOs BLAS is enabled by default.
make RELEASE=1 BLAS=1

# Advanced knobs
make                                               # Debug mode
make RELEASE=1 MCTS_ITER_CNT=1600                  # Really strong nn player but slow
make RELEASE=1 MCTS_ITER_CNT=400                   # Strong nn player but faster
make RELEASE=1 MCTS_ITER_CNT=1600 MCTS_SELF_PLAY=1 # Two nn players play each other

```
Have fun!

### Performance and BLAS

After a few days of development, the performance is reasonably acceptable when
MCTS is not utilized. No performance optimizations—such as operation fusion,
multi-threading, or SIMD—have been applied. Nevertheless, the C implementation
demonstrates substantial speed and outperforms the original Python and
PyTorch-based version

However, the MCTS agent invokes the `conv2d` operation excessively, resulting in
a performance bottleneck. This behavior is anticipated, as `conv2d` and `matmul`
(matrix multiplication) are among the most computationally intensive layers in
deep learning models.


This is a sample of the profiling result:

  0.00     27.87     0.00      237     0.00     0.12  nn_forward
...
```

To accelerate the `conv2d` operation, the `im2col + matmul` technique is employed
(refer to this
[page](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#:~:text=Implementation%20as%20Matrix,output%20dimension%20[55x55x96].)
for the algorithm).
The `im2col` transformation incurs minimal
overhead, while the matrix multiplication step (`matmul`) leverages the highly
optimized `BLAS` routine `cblas_sgemm`. In local testing on macOs, this approach
yielded a `50x`–60x performance improvement, benefiting from the `Accelerate`
framework, which is enabled by default when macOs is detected.

On Debian/Linux, I have tested `openblas` as follows
```
# Debian
sudo apt install libopenblas-dev
make RELEASE=1 BLAS=1
```

On other system, once `openblas` or any `BLAS` library is installed, it should
work as follows
```
# ARCH
sudo pacman -S blas-openblas
CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/openblas make RELEASE=1 BLAS=1

# macOS with old SDK
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.3
make RELEASE=1
```
