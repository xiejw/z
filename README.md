## Curated Project Lists

- **Connect 4** ([c4](./c4)): A MCTS based AI agent which can play [connect
  four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). It is
  quite strong.  Click [here](c4/README.md) to get started.
  - [c4c](./c4c) is a pure c implementation (<1050L) without any dependency. It
    also has MCTS agent so fun to play.
- **Dancing Link** ([dlink](./dlink)): An advanced data structure implementing
  backtracking algorithms, for the exact cover problem (XC). This can be
  extended to help exact cover with colors problem (XCC).
- **SAT Solver** ([sat](./sat)): Few algorithms which aim to solve the Boolean
  satisfiability problem (SAT).
- **Tic Tac Toe** ([ttt](./ttt)): A [forked](https://github.com/antirez/ttt-rl)
  Tic Tac Toe agent backed by Reinforcement Learning.
