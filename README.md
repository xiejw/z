### AI

- **Connect 4** ([c4c](./c4c)): A MCTS based AI agent which can play [connect
  four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). Written in pure c (<1050L)
  without any dependency. It is quite strong.
  - [c4c](./c4c): Python version. Click [here](c4/README.md) to get started.

### TAOCP

This section covers fundamental algorithms as presented in The Art of Computer
Programming (TAOCP). It provides implementation details and practical code
examples for core concepts, including Boolean basics, backtracking techniques,
and related combinatorial algorithms.

## Code Names

- _Forge_: Focused on foundational system libraries and design. The name signifies
the creation of essential, high-performance building blocks—the "smithy" where
our core infrastructure is forged. Each component is meticulously engineered to
ensure peak performance and long-term durability.

- _Hermes_: Dedicated to advanced ML/AI system libraries. Inspired by the god of
  speed and communication, Hermes focuses on high-velocity data flow and masters
  the art of function approximation. It delivers elegant solutions to
  sophisticated, real-world challenges by managing intricate low-level details
  with absolute precision.
